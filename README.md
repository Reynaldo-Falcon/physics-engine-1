# physics-engine-1
First attempt at a physics engine. Works for any number of dimensions. Calculates movements and rotations due to conservative forces and conservative torques for inertial frames. Will be expanded to more specific situations including rigid and soft bodies, non-inertial frames, and non-conservative forces.
